/**
 * A matcher; an object that uses a regular expression to search or match.
 * A has a {@link java.lang.CharSequence} that it applies to; it is created
 * over one, and can be switched to a new one with {@link #reset(CharSequence)}.
 * Matchers perform two operations: matching and searching. Matching ({@link #matches()}
 * attempts to satisfy the pattern with the entire string. Searching scans forward
 * through the string looking for a substring that satisfies the pattern.
 * <br/>
 * A matcher has a region. Initially, the region is the entire data, but
 * the application may call {@link #region(int, int)} to change it. Setting a region
 * limits the data examined by the matcher, but does not change the interpretation
 * of the offset passed to {@link #find(int)} or the values returned by the
 * methods of {@link java.util.regex.MatchResult}. These are always relative to the complete
 * data.
 * <br/>
 * Matchers support an iterative scanning process for multiple matches. After a successful call
 * to {@link #find()} or {@link #find(int)}, the matcher retains the offset of the end of the match.
 * A subsequent call to {@link #find()} starts at the character after the previous match.
